# Ronin

It is an open Riichi Mahjong game server and client that you can run on your infrastructure.

Ronin is in an early stage of development, the server is still cooking, and a client doesn't exist at all.

## Backend

The server is a WebSocket app: Python + Starlette.

## Frontend

The client is planned to be a TypeScript app (not React).
